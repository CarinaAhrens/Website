                In sociolinguistics, I am interested in the sound level of
                language. I investigate how pronunciation is influenced by
                social factors such as age, gender, sex, and class. As student
                assistant, I am working in the DFG-funded project
                <i>Tacking Language Variation and Change across the Lifespan</i>
                (LaVaLi) hosted in the Sociolinguistics Lab at the University
                Duisburg-Essen led by Isabelle Buchstaller. The project explores
                how people's speech changes over the course of their lifespan.
                The data used within the project comes from the Tyneside area in
                the Northeast of England. For more information about this
                project visit the

              My interests in psycholinguistics lie in multilingualism. I am
              especially interested in the way different learned languages
              interact in multilingual speakers' minds. My goal is to combine
              methods and approaches from sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics
              to investigate whether studies conducted in laboratories are
              representative of everyday languages. My interest in
              multilingualism comes from my own experience as I spent my first
              year of university in France. While I was using French every day
              to improve my language skills, I rarely used English which I
             had learned in school and used in my day-to-day life (e.g., while
              watching TV). Whenever I tried to speak English, it was quite
              hard. I accidentally slipped back into French.

              My interest in history focuses on the end of the Middle Ages and
              the beginning of the Renaissance. I am particularly interested in
              the Medici family, which lived from the 12th to the 15th century
              in Florence and helped shape the political landscape. The Medici
              owe their rise to power to their skills in the banking business.
              Through calculated risks, the family rose from a simple banking
              family to Dukes and Duchess of Tuscany and produced three popes
              over the course of history. Additionally, I am interested in the
              Borgia family, who are said to have been involved in many scandals
              during their time in the Vatican.

              In musicology I am interested in two different areas: I like to
              combine linguistics and history with music. In
              historical musicology, I am looking into the relationship between
              Lorenzo il Magnifico and his musicians. So far, not a lot of
              research has been done in this area. Most studies focus on
              Lorenzo's relationship with other artists (e.g., painters or
              sculptors). For the combination of musicology and linguistics, I
              like to look at how music influences the acquisition of
              languages and how both language and music are processed.
